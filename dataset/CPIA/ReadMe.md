# CPIA Details&Summary
In order to facilitate users to use the CPIA dataset, we prepared two tables to show the details. The two tables are respectively CPIA_summary.xlsx and CPIA_details.xlsx. The use of each folder is described in detail below:

## CPIA_summary.xlsx
The table divides the data into two categories: WSI and ROI. And this table gives a detailed description of the information in each sub-dataset.

### [Sub-dataset name]
This column is the name of the processed sub-datasets under the CPIA framework, and the corresponding datasets compression package can be found according to the information in this column.

### [Original name]
This column is the original name of the initial publication of the sub-datasets.
### [Organ/tissue]
This column lists organ/tissue categories covered by pathological images in different sub-datasets. Researchers can find processed sub-datasets of specified categories according to their needs. Some sub-datasets contain pathological images of multiple organs.
### [Disease]
This column lists disease categories in pathological images in different sub-datasets. Some sub-datasets contain pathological images of multiple disease categories.
### [Total number]
This column is the number of processed samples in the CPIA sub-datasets.
### [Storage]
Due to the large-scale feature of the CPIA dataset, we store CPIA in nine links under the SicenceDB. This column is the storage number where the different sub-datasets are located. The user can find the corresponding complete sub-dataset in the specified link.
### [Dyeing method]
This column is the dyeing methods for pathological images in different sub-datasets.
### [Field]
This column divides the sub-datasets into histopathology and cytopathology.
### [Time] 
This column lists the year each dataset was published.
### [Dataset linking]
This column is the download links of the original datasets. Users can follow the links to find more detailed descriptions and information about the original datasets.
### [Related literatures or acknowledgement]
This column are the original articles or web of the sub-datasets. Because the number of articles is too large, these articles are not directly quoted in our paper, but are organized in this table.

## CPIA_details.xlsx
This table consists of three sheets in total. This corresponds to the three scales of the CPIA dataset: L, M, and S. The user can find the name of the sub-dataset and the number of samples at that scale in the corresponding sheet.
